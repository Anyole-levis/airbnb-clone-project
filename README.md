# airbnb-clone-project
# The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# Project Goals
  User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
  Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
  Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
  Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
# Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
# Team Roles 
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
# Database Design 
1. User
Represents a person using the platform, either as a host or guest.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Email address (unique)

passwordHash: Encrypted password

role: "guest" or "host"

Relationships:

A user can list many properties (if a host)

A user can make many bookings (if a guest)

A user can leave many reviews

A user can receive many payments (if a host)

2. Property
Represents a listing available for rent.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier

title: Name of the listing

description: Detailed information about the property

location: City, country, or coordinates

pricePerNight: Cost per night

Relationships:

A property belongs to one user (host)

A property can have many bookings

A property can have many reviews

3. Booking
Represents a reservation made by a user.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier

userId: ID of the guest

propertyId: ID of the booked property

startDate: Booking start date

endDate: Booking end date

Relationships:

A booking belongs to one user (guest)

A booking is for one property

A booking may have one payment associated
# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile information. It supports role-based access control, distinguishing between guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties). Authentication and authorization ensure secure access to user-specific actions.

2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, price, location, and images. This feature is crucial for enabling the supply side of the platform where users can offer accommodations.

3. Booking System
Guests can browse listings and book properties for specific dates. The system checks availability, prevents double bookings, and calculates pricing based on the stay duration. This is the core transactional feature that connects guests with hosts.

# API Security
 1. Authentication ; Verifying user identity using email/password or OAuth providers
    Ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts, protecting sensitive data like personal info, bookings, and payment details. Without secure authentication, attackers could easily impersonate users.
 2. Authorization ; Controlling what authenticated users are allowed to do (e.g., only hosts can create listings, only guests can book)
    Prevents unauthorized actions like a user deleting someone elseâ€™s property or accessing admin-only features. Role-based permissions keep user actions within their boundaries.
 3. Rate Limiting ;Limiting the number of requests a user/IP can make to the server in a given timeframe.
    Prevents abuse through brute-force attacks (e.g., trying thousands of passwords) or spamming endpoints. It also protects the platform from DDoS attacks that can degrade performance.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.
A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring that new changes can be safely and quickly pushed to production.
 Recommended Tools for CI/CD in this Project
GitHub Actions	Automate workflows for testing, building, and deploying from your GitHub repository.
Docker	Package the application into containers to ensure consistent environments across dev, test, and prod.
Vercel / Netlify	For auto-deploying the frontend (e.g., Next.js) directly from GitHub.
Render / Railway / Heroku	For hosting and auto-deploying the backend with support for CI pipelines.
Jest / Cypress	For running unit and end-to-end tests automatically
